# Plotting-Formula-1-Circuits

This repo demonstrates how to extract, transform, and visualise Formula 1 race data using the FastF1 Python API and Tableau. With just a few lines of code (and a pinch of trigonometry), you can map out F1 circuits from fastest laps and create stunning track visualisations.

Includes:

📦 Python scripts to fetch circuit data from Fast F1 API 

🔄 Track rotation logic for accurate orientation

📁 CSVs ready for Tableau plotting

📅 Optionally includes small multiples of all 2024 tracks

Perfect for motorsport fans, data analysts, and F1 nerds who want to geek out with data.
